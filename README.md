DATASET
We will use the dataset at 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Plants, extracted from the USDA plant dataset. This dataset lists the plants found in US and Canadian states.
The dataset is available in data/plants.data, in CSV format. Every line in this file contains a tuple where the first element is the name of a plant, and the remaining elements are the states in which the plant is found. State abbreviations are in data/stateabbr.txt for your 
information.

The solution aims to divide the problem in set of functions where each function describes the function or the problem it targets.
A stepwise approve has been proven right in learning process.

To run the task simply read the function doc and run it.

Thanks!
